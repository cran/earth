This dataset is included in the earth package because it is a convenient
vehicle for illustrating earth's GLM and factor handling.

The dataset was compiled by Frank Harrell and Robert Dawson:
\url{http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic.html}\cr
See also:\cr
\url{http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3info.txt}.

For this version of the Titanic data,
passenger details and incomplete cases were deleted
and the name changed to \code{etitanic} to minimize confusion with other
versions ("e" because it is part of the earth package).

Note that \code{survived} is an integer (it should arguably be a logical).

How \code{etitanic} was built:
    \preformatted{
    load("titanic3") # from Harrell's web site
    # discard name, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked, body, home.dest
    etitanic <- titanic3[,c(1,2,4,5,6,7)]
    etitanic <- etitanic[!is.na(etitanic$age),]
    save(etitanic, file="etitanic.rda")
    }
