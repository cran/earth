earth/src/tests/README
----------------------

The tests in this directory are much more comprehensive than
tests\test.earth.R but also take much longer to execute.

For regression tests on earth.c: run test.earthc.bat
For regression tests of earth with a variety of models: run test.earth.full.bat
For regression tests on plotmo: run test.plotmo.bat
For some timing test results: see timing-tests.txt

None of these test appropriate behaviour for bad arguments.

If your program is independent of R and you want to use the routines
in earth.c then earth.h will be useful.
