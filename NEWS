Changes to Earth Package
------------------------

2.0-1 June 10 2008 

Added "namesx" and "first" arguments to the "allowed" function.
evimp() for a scalar x now returns a matrix (I added a missing drop=FALSE).

2.0-0 June 07 2008 

Added support for glms and factors (but plotmo does not yet support factors).
Added variable importance function "evimp".
Added response weights argument "wp" to earth.
Output of summary.earth has changed to better deal
   with multiple response models, see the "style" argument.
Added namesx and namesx.org to earth's return value.

1.3-2 Mar 29 2008

Fixed two bad multiple response bugs:
a) for multiple reponse models, earth calculated the wrong null RSS and
   therefore the wrong RSq and GRSq for the sub-models.  (The total
   RSq and GRSq were correct.)
b) the wrong betas were used when pruning multiple response models.

Also fixed a bug where summary.earth printed the wrong number
of cases for multiple response models.

1.3-1 Mar 22 2008

"update.earth" now has a "ponly" argument, to force pruning only.
Because of this change, the "ppenalty" argument to earth is no longer
needed and has been removed.

Revisited text of warnings after I was bamboozled by one of
my own warnings.

Tweaked legend positioning in plot.earth.models.

1.3-0 Mar 18 2008

Default minspan is now 0 (was 1) for compatibility with mda:mars and
Friedman's MARS paper (I've flip flopped on this one).  This means
that models built with the default args will be little different to
before.

Earth's peak memory is now about 40% less.

Big models are now more responsive to ^C.

For multiple response models, we now print response names in most
places instead of just "Response N".

Removed get.nterms.per.degree and get.nused.preds.per.subset from
NAMESPACE and from help pages, to simplify user interface.

Fixed some niggling document issues and extended the FAQ.

1.2-2 Jan 2008

print.summary.earth now prints the call even for x,y interface to earth
plotmo now accepts x matrices without column names
Tweaked FindKnot and OrthogResiduals for speed
Removed a few shadowed variables in earth.c after running gcc -Wshadow
Clarified some paras in earth.Rd, reduced page width for better html display

1.2-1

Fixed a newvar.penalty bug introduced in previous release.
Added src/tests/test.earthmain.gcc.bat
More man page tweaks

1.2-0

Added linpreds, allowed, and Use.beta.cache arguments
Anova decomp is now more consistent
Added a few GPL headers
Reinstated the beta cache
More man page tweaks

1.1-5

Fixed bug reported by Joe Ritzer: long predictor names got munged in plotmo
Changed "class" to "response" throughout when used for the
predicted responses in the input y.
Man page tweaks based on user feedback.

1.1-4

Changed as.matrix to data.matrix in earth.default -- grep for FIXED
Extended earth.Rd slightly

1.1-2

Added my web page to DESCRIPTION and to some man pages

1.1-1

Changed \r\n to \n to pacify CMD CHECK

1.1-0

Default minspan is now 1 (was 0)
Fixed potential crash in PrintForwardStep if nTrace>1
Added a missing drop=FALSE to backward()
Minor code, comment, and man page fixups

1.0-8

Fixed bug where plotmo failed under these circumstances:
form <- Volume ~ .; a <- earth(form, data = trees); plotmo(a)

1.0-7

Minor change to summary.earth formatting.  Man page fixes.

1.0-6

Initial release
